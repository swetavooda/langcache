    "## Analysis and observations from the workflow profiling\n",
    "One of the major bottle neck observed during the workflow profiling was the overhead for SentenceFeature Extractor (i.e., function used to calculate the feature embedding value)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "The curent implementation calculated the feature embedding for every entry in the cache table to find the most similar cache entry from the database. It is to be noted that the SentenceFeature function has a significant overhead since it needs to compute the embedding for a given sentence(text). Computing this value each time is going to negatively impact performance of the cache library. Therefore, it is necessary to find solutions to avoid this overhead and improve the performance of the SentenceFeature extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed solution\n",
    "Instead of computing the embeddings each time on database search, we can precompute the embedding and store the feature in a separate column of the cache database to avoid the repeated overhead."
